# Final Project for CS 5004 - (Food Wizard)

## Description
Food Wizard aims to assist users in discovering recipes based on the ingredients they have available. By selecting ingredients they possess, the system will suggest corresponding recipes, minimizing food waste and inspiring meal preparation.

## Background
